<h1>CardFRP Unit Testing</h1>
</center>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>
The unit testing for the CardFRP component is broken into two parts:
<ul>
   <li>	Each basic class will have its own basic unit test suite in the same
	module as the implementation.  All of these test cases will be automatically
	run out of the <tt>__main__()</tt> method, and will <tt>assert()</tt> to
	check the correctness of each test-case.
	<P>
	This is done to keep the per-method test cases tightly bundled with the
	code they exercise, and to make it trivial to re-test a particular module
	after it is updated.
	</li>
   <li> The more interesting test cases use the combined classes to carry out
   	more complex (and realistic) play scenarios.  These are implemented 
	in a <em>pytest</em> test suite.
	<p>
	Note that these scenario tests are also likely to be interesting as
	sample code for using the CardFRP component.
	</li>
</ul>
</P>

<H2>Per-Class Unit Testing</H2>

<A name="gameobject"/><H3>GameObject Unit Testing</H3>
<P>
The most interesting code in the <em>GameObject</em> class is the
<tt>possible_actions()</tt> method, which is the focus of the 
in-class unit tests.
The <tt>accept_action()</tt> and <em>hidden object</em> search
is better tested by play scenarios.
</p>
The basic <tt>possible_actions</tt> unit test cases are:
<ul>
   <li>	a newly created <em>GameObject</em> supports no actions and
   	has no ACCURACY, DAMAGE, POWER or STACKS attributes</li>

   <li> correct attributes and verb for a single ATTACK -<br>
   	a <em>GameObject</em> with a single ATTACK, and base ACCURACY
        and DAMAGE attributes returns a list containing a single 
	<em>GameAction</em> with those attributes</li>

   <li> correct list of verbs from list of ACTIONS -<br>
   	a <em>GameObject</em> with two possible verbs returns a list
   	containing exactly those two <em>GameAction</em>s</li>

   <li> correct attribute lists for compound actions -<br>
   	a <em>GameObject</em> with one basic ATTACK and two sub-types
   	of that ATTACK returns a list containing those three
	<em>GameAction</em>s, and the ACCURACY and DAMAGE of the
	sub-type <em>GameAction</em>s include both the base and
	sub-type ACCURACY and DAMAGE attributes.</li>

   <li>	correct default values for inapplicable or unspecified attributes -<br>
   	for a <em>GameObject</em> with two compound verbs, both
   	of which involve a combination of ATTACK and condition
	verbs, some of which have sub-type ACCURACY and DAMAGE,
	or POWER and STACKS (in addition to the base ACCURACY,
	DAMAGE, POWER and STACKS) attributes, 
	the <em>GameAction</em> ATTACK, DAMAGE, POWER, and STACKS
	attributes are each a list containing the correct sums
	of base and sub-type values for the individual elements
	of the compound verbs.</li>

   <li> for a <em>GameObject</em> with a compound verb, including
   	both ATTACK and condition actions, each of which has no base
	attributes, but sub-type ACCURACY, DAMAGE, POWER and STACKS
	attributes,
	the <em>GameAction</em> ATTACK, DAMAGE, POWER, and STACKS
	attributes are each a list containing the correct sub-type
	attribute values, and the unused slots (because the verb
	in that position does not have that attribute) is <tt>0</tt>,
	(except for STACKS, in which case the default value is <tt>1</tt>).
	</li>
</ul>

<A name="gameaction"/><H3>GameAction Unit Testing</H3>
<P>
The interesting code is in the <tt>act()</tt> method, where
we want to ensure that, given a verb, the right base and
initiator bonuses are used to compute the correct
<tt>TO_HIT</tt> and <tt>TOTAL</tt> attributes before
passing the action to the target.  More specifically:
<ul>
   <li> the correct attributes (ACCURACY vs POWER,
   	and DAMAGE vs STACKS) are used, depending on the verb</li>
   <li> the correct base verb values are used </li>
   <li> correct sub-type values are used </li>
   <li> the initiator's base and sub-type (ACCURACY, POWER,
   	DAMAGE, and STACKS) are correctly added to the base values.
   <li> compound verbs result in the correct sequence of 
   	GameActions being delivered</li>
</ul>
We will do this do this by creating appropriate initiators and
<em>GameAction</em>s, and using their <tt>act()</tt> method to 
send them to a test target that returns a result string that
describes all of the parameters it received.
</P>
<P>
The processing involved in the sub-type and compound verbs for 
both the base actions and initiator abilities are sufficiently
complex that these sub-case tests should count as <u>white-box</u> testing.
</P>
<P>
The base-case <tt>ATTACK</tt> and condition delivery tests will simply ensure that 
the correct base attributes (<tt>ACCURACY</tt> and <tt>DAMAGE</tt>
or <tt>POWER</tt> and <tt>STACKS</tt>) are used for <em>GameAction</em>s
with both base-case verbs and sub-typed verbs ... with no initiator bonuses:
<TABLE border="1">
    <tr><th>verb</th>
    	<th>ACCURACY</th>
	<th>DAMAGE</th>
	<th>expected TO_HIT</th>
	<th>expected TOTAL</th>
    </tr>
    <tr> <td>"ATTACK"</td>		<td>None</td>	<td>"1"</td>	<td>100</td>	<td>1</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>"ATTACK.ten"</td>		<td>10</td>	<td>"10"</td>	<td>110</td>	<td>10</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>"ATTACK.twenty"</td>	<td>20</td>	<td>"20"</td>	<td>120</td>	<td>20</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>"ATTACK.thirty"</td>	<td>30</td>	<td>"30"</td>	<td>130</td>	<td>30</td> </tr>
</TABLE>
</P>
<P>
<TABLE border="1">
    <tr><th>verb</th>
    	<th>POWER</th>

	<th>expected TO_HIT</th>
	<th>expected TOTAL</th>
    </tr>
    <tr> <td>"MENTAL"</td>	<td>None</td>	<td>"1"</td>	<td>100</td>	<td>1</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>"MENTAL.X"</td>	<td>10</td>	<td>"10"</td>	<td>110</td>	<td>10</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>"MENTAL.Y"</td>	<td>20</td>	<td>"20"</td>	<td>120</td>	<td>20</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>"MENTAL.Z"</td>	<td>30</td>	<td>"30"</td>	<td>130</td>	<td>30</td> </tr>
</TABLE>
</P>
<P>
The sub-type <tt>ATTACK</tt> and condition delivery tests will ensure that the 
correct (base or sub-type) initiator (<tt>ACCURACY</tt> and <tt>DAMAGE</tt>
or <tt>POWER</tt> and <tt>STACKS</tt>) attributes are used for <em>GameAction</em>s
with both base-case verbs and sub-typed verbs.
</P>
<P>
The initiator will have:
<ul>
   <li>	ACCURACY=10, DAMAGE="10"</li>
   <li>	ACCURACY.twenty=20, DAMAGE.twenty="20"</li>
   <li>	ACCURACY.thirty=30, DAMAGE.thirty="30"</li>
   <li>	POWER.MENTAL=10, STACKS.MENTAL="10"</li>
   <li>	POWER.MENTAL.Y=20, STACKS.MENTAL.Y="20"</li>
   <li>	POWER.MENTAL.Z=30, STACKS.MENTAL.Z="30"</li>

</ul>
We will then initiate the following Game actions and ensure that the correct 
(base plus sub-type) initiator bonuses have been added to the <tt>TO_HIT</tt> and <tt>TOTAL</tt>

    <tr> <td>"ATTACK.thirty"</td>	<td>30</td>	<td>"30"</td>	<td>170</td>	<td>70</td> </tr>

</TABLE>
</P>
<P>
To test compound verbs, we will create an artifact with a compound attack
(with different <tt>ACCURACY</tt>, <tt>DAMAGE</tt>, <tt>POWER<tt> and <tt>STACKS</tt>
for each of the individual verbs), invoke that compound action with the
<em>GameAction</em>.<tt>act()</tt> method, and confirm (with the test target response)
that each of the individual verbs was delivered separately, in-order, with the
correct <tt>ACCURACY</tt>, <tt>DAMAGE</tt>, <tt>POWER</tt> and <tt>STACKS</tt>:
<ul>
    <li> verb = "ATTACK.one+MENTAL.two+ATTACK.three+PHYSICAL.four+VERBAL.five+FAIL+WONT-HAPPEN"</li>
    <li> <tt>ACCURACY</tt> = "1,3"</li>
    <li> <tt>DAMAGE</tt> = "10,30"</li>
    <li> <tt>POWER</tt> = "2,4,5,0"</li>
    <li> <tt>STACKS</tt> = "2,4,5,0"</li>
</ul>
Expected results:
<ul>
    <li> ATTACK.one (TO_HIT=101, DAMAGE=10)</li>
    <li> MENTAL.two (TO_HIT=102, STACKS=2)</li>
    <li> ATTACK.three (TO_HIT=103, DAMAGE=30)</li>
    <li> PHYSICAL.four (TO_HIT=104, STACKS=4)</li>
    <li> VERBAL.five (TO_HIT=105, STACKS=5)</li>
    <li> resists FAIL ... because the base and initiator powers were both 0</li>
</ul>
A compound verb action stops as soon as one of the sub-verbs fail.
Since the <tt>FAIL</tt> action will be succesfully resisted,
the results should include no mention of the <tt>WONT-HAPPEN</tt> action.
</p>

<A name="dice"/><H3>Dice Unit Testing</H3>
<P>
The <em>Dice</em> class is simple and independent, and so should be
very easy to test.  There are two obvious types of tests:
<ul>
    <li> tests of all types of legal formula, to make sure
         that the (a) are accepted and (b) that they result
	 in correct rolls.</li>
    <li> tests of likely illegal formula, to make sure that
         they are rejected.</li>
</ul>
The easiest way to test correct rolling is to do many more rolls
than the range width, and ensure that all returned rolls are 
within the expected range.  I will write a routine:
<pre>
    test(
	 string formula,	# dice roll formula
	 int min_expected,	# lowest legal return value
	 int max_expected,	# highest legal return value
	 int num_rolls)		# number of rolls to test
</pre>
that will do this, and use it to test each of the basic types of roll formula:
<TABLE border="1">
    <tr><th align=center>formula</th>
    	<th align=center>min expected</th>
	<th align=center>max expected</th>
	<th align=center>num rolls</th> </tr>
    <tr> <td>"3D4"</td>		<td>3</td>	<td>12</td>	<td>40</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>"d20"</td>		<td>1</td>	<td>20</td>	<td>80</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>"D%"</td>		<td>1</td>	<td>100</td>	<td>300</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>"2D2+3"</td>	<td>5</td>	<td>7</td>	<td>7</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>"3-9"</td>		<td>3</td>	<td>9</td>	<td>9</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>"47"</td>		<td>47</td>	<td>47</td>	<td>10</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>47</td>		<td>47</td>	<td>47</td>	<td>10</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>"-3"</td>		<td>-3</td>	<td>-3</td>	<td>10</td> </tr>
</TABLE>
</P>

<P>
The obvious formula errors are typos and missing values:
<ul>
    <li> missing number of faces (e.g. "2D")</li>
    <li> non-numeric limits, number of dice, or number of faces (e.g. "D", "xDy", "x-y")</li>
    <li> ranges where the last number is missing or lower than the first (e.g. "-", "4-2", "3-")</li>
    <li> ranges using a separator other than "-" (e.g. "7 to 9")</li>
</ul>
