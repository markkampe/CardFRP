<h1>CardFRP Unit Testing</h1>
</center>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>
The unit testing for the CardFRP component is intended to exercise all 
non-trivial methods in the basic CardFRP classes
(<em>GameObject, GameActor, GameContext, GameAction</em>, and <em>Dice</em>).
This testing will be broken into two parts:
<ul>
   <li>	Each basic class will have its own basic unit test suite in the same
	module as the implementation.  All of these test cases will be automatically
	run out of the <tt>__main__()</tt> method, and will <tt>assert()</tt> to
	check the correctness of each test-case.
	This is a stardard model for technique for Python class unit-testing, and
	has the advantage of keeping the per-method test cases tightly bundled with
	the code they exercise (and ensuring that they always match).
	</li>
   <li> More interesting test cases involve operations that combine the
   	capabilities of multiple classes.  These will be implemented by a
	<em>PyTest</em> test suite.
	</li>
</ul>
In addition to the above pass/fail test cases, we will also provide sample
code to exercise a wide range of common game scenarios (e.g. searches,
interactions, combat, scrolls).
</P>

<H2>Per-Class Unit Testing</H2>

<A name="gameobject"/><H3>GameObject Unit Testing</H3>
<P>
The most interesting code in the <em>GameObject</em> class is the
<tt>possible_actions()</tt> and <tt>accept_action()</tt> methods.
The test cases to exercise them are combinations of situations to
exercise different paths through the code ... and so should be
regarded as <em>white box</em> test cases.
</p>
The <tt>possible_actions()</tt> functionality to be exercised is:
<ul>
   <li>	a newly created <em>GameObject</em> returns no actions and
   	has no ACCURACY, DAMAGE, POWER or STACKS attributes</li>

   <li> if the ACTIONS attribute is a single, or a list of multiple
   	(simple or compound) verbs, <tt>possible_actions()</tt> will
	return a list containing only (and all of) those verbs</li>

   <li> for each ATTACK verb in ACTIONS, it will correctly compute
   	ACCURACY and DAMAGE by adding the <em>GameObject</em>s
	base-verb and subtype ACCURACY and DAMAGE attributes</li>

   <li> for each non-ATTACK verb in ACTIONS, it will correctly compute
   	POWER and STACKS by adding the <em>GameObject</em>s
	base-verb and subtype POWER and STACKS attributes</li>

   <li> for a compound action (multiple verbs separated by +)
   	the ACCURACY, DAMAGE, POWER and STACKs attributes will
	each be a list, with the correct number of entries,
	and the correct values in each slot (in the same order
	as the verbs)</li>
</ul>

A set of test cases to exercise this functionality would be:
<ul>

   <li> create a new <em>GameObject</em>, get its <tt>possible_actions</tt>,
   	and confirm the emptiness of the list and the absence of any
	ACCURACY/DAMAGE/POWER/STACKS attributes.</li>

   <li> create a new <em>GameObject</em>, with a single ATTACK verb
   	and only base-verb ACCURACY and DAMAGE, 
   	call <tt>possible_actions()</tt>, and confirm that the
	returned list of <em>GameAction</em>s contains only that verb
	with those attributes.</li>

   <li> create a new <em>GameObject</em>, with a multiple ACTIONS,
   	call <tt>possible_actions()</tt>,
	and confirm that correct (verb and attributes) <em>GameActions</em>
	are returned for each.</li>

   <li> create a new <em>GameObject</em>, with multiple compound
   	verbs (both ATTACK and non-ATTACK), some of which have
	sub-type (in addition to base-verb) attributes, 
	call <tt>possible_actions()</tt> and
	<ul>
	   <li> confirm that the ACCURACY/DAMAGE/POWER/STACKS attributes 
	   	of the returned <em>GameAction</em>s 
		contain the propper values (sums of base and sub-type
		attributes, in the same order as their corresponding verbs)</li>
	   <li> confirm the entries for which there should be no values
	   	(e.g. the third entry in the POWER list when the third verb
		was an ATTACK) are <tt>0</tt>.</li>
	</ul> </li>
</ul>

<P>
The <tt>accept_action()</tt> method in this base class only knows
how to handle attribute-changing verbs.  ATTACK verbs are handled
by the <em>GameActor</em> sub-class.
The functionality to be exercised is:
<ul>
   <li>	proper summation of general RESISTANCE, and the verb-appropriate
   	RESISTANCE.verb, and RESISTANCE.verb.subtype attributes.
	</li>

   <li> proper iteration through the incoming STACKS, and proper 
   	comparison of TO_HIT and RESISTANCE+D100 to determine whether
	or not a given STACK of the action is delivered.
	</li>

   <li> proper update of receiver attributes in response to successful
   	delivery of (both positive and negative) actions.
	</li>

   <li> ensuring that LIFE cannot be raised above HP, by doing
   	multiple (guaranteed to succeed) actions that would
	raise it more than possible.</li>

   <li> success is returned only if some STACKS are delivered</li>

   <li> returned status message correctly reflects complete RESISTANCE or
   	the number of STACKS successfully delivered</li>
</ul>

A set of test cases to exercise this functionality would be:
<ul>
   <li> pass actions for which there are various combinations
   	of base, verb, and sub-type RESISTANCE (in values that
	will cause the action to succeed or fail based on which
	terms are included) and confirm that each action succeeds
	or fails appropriately.

   <li> pass actions with large numbers of STACKS (some guaranteed to
   	all succeed, some guaranteed to all fail, and some succeeding
	or failing based on the roll), and confirm
	<ul>
	   <li> that success return value is true if any STACKS were delivered</li>
   	   <li>	(by parsing the status) that the number blocked is proportional to
		(D100 + RESISTANCE - TO_HIT)/100</li>
	   <li> that the affected attributes have been
	   	correctly updates</li>
	   <li> that it is impossible to raise LIFE above HP, even
	   	if enough STACKS to do so get through</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
The <tt>load()</tt> method, which draws on other classes, will be
exercised (for both <em>GameActor</em>s and <em>GameContext</em>s
in the game <em>PyTest</em> tests.
</P>

<A name="gameaction"/><H3>GameAction Unit Testing</H3>
<P>
The interesting code is in the <tt>act()</tt> method, where we
recognize and split up compound verbs, decide which (object and
initiator, (base and sub-type) ACCURACY, DAMAGE, POWER and STACKS
attributes apply to each, compute TO_HIT and TOTAL attributes,
and pass these to the recipient's <tt>accept_action()</tt> method.
</P>
<P>
The functionality to be exercised is:
<ul>
   <li> breaking compound (separated by +) verbs into distinct
     	(single-verb) actions, delivered to the recipient,
	in the correct order</li>

   <li>	correct selection and combination of the action's base,
   	verb, and sub-type ACCURACY/POWER attributes with any
	corresponding initiator bonuses to compute the TO_HIT
	for each delivered action</li>

   <li>	correct selection and combination of the action's base,
   	verb, and sub-type DAMAGE/STACKS attributes with any
	corresponding initiator bonuses to compute the TOTAL
	for each delivered action</li>
   	
   <li>	ensuring that those correctly calculated values are
   	received by the recipient's <tt>accept_action()</tt> method</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
A set of test cases to exercise this functionality would be:
<ul>
   <li> create <em>GameAction</em>s with a simple ATTACK, and
   	multiple sub-types, each of which has specified
	(base) ACCURACY and DAMAGE attributes.<br>
	Confirm that the delivered <em>GameAction</em>
	has the correct verb, TO_HIT and TOTAL attributes.</li>

   <li> create <em>GameAction</em>s with a simple ATTACK, and
   	multiple sub-types, each of which has specified
	(base) ACCURACY and DAMAGE attributes.<br>
	Create an initiator who has base ACCURACY and DAMAGE
	bonuses, as well as sub-type bonuses for some
	(but not all) of the verbs.<br>
	Confirm that the delivered <em>GameAction</em>
	has the correct verb, TO_HIT and TOTAL attributes.</li>

   <li> create <em>GameAction</em>s with a simple MENTAL action,
   	and multiple sub-types, each of which has specified
	(base) POWER and STACKS attributes.<br>
	Confirm that the delivered <em>GameAction</em>
	has the correct verb, TO_HIT and TOTAL attributes.</li>

   <li> create <em>GameAction</em>s with a simple MENTAL action,
   	and multiple sub-types, each of which has specified
	(base) POWER and STACKS attributes.<br>
	Create an initiator who has base POWER and STACKS
	bonuses, as well as sub-type bonuses for some
	(but not all) of the verbs.<br>
	Confirm that the delivered <em>GameAction</em>
	has the correct verb, TO_HIT and TOTAL attributes.</li>

   <li> create a <em>GameAction</em> with a compound action
   	involving both ATTACK and MENTAL/VERBAL/PHYSICAL verbs,
	with ACCURACY, DAMAGE, POWER, and STACKS attributes
	that contain lists of values (corresponding to each
	of the verbs in the compound action).<br>
	Call <tt>act()</tt> to deliver those actions, and
	confirm that each of the test recipient received 
	each of those verbs with its correct TO_HIT and STACKS
	attributes.</li>

   <li> create a <em>GameAction</em> with a compound action,
   	where one of the later actions will fail (POWER=0).
	Call <tt>act()</tt> to deliver those actions, and
	confirm that no verbs after the failure were delivered
	to the recipient.</li>
</ul>

In support of the last two, we will create a test-recipient, who's
<tt>accept_action</tt> method simply returns (as status) the verb
and attribute values.  The test functions can parse this output to
confirm that the received <em>GameAction</em> had the expected
verb, TO_HIT and TOTAL attributes, in the correct order.
</P>
<P>
The test cases to exercise this are combinations of situations to
exercise different paths through the code ... and so should be
regarded as <em>white box</em> test cases.
</P>

<A name="dice"/><H3>Dice Unit Testing</H3>
<P>
The <em>Dice</em> class is simple and independent, and so should be
very easy to test.  There are two obvious types of tests:
<ul>
   <li> (<em>black-box</em>) tests of each type of legal formula,
	to make sure that the (a) are accepted and (b) that they result
	in correct rolls.</li>
   <li> tests of likely illegal formula, to make sure that
	they are rejected.</li>
</ul>
The easiest way to test correct rolling is to do many more rolls
than the range width, and ensure that all returned rolls are 
within the expected range.  I will write a routine:
<pre>
    test(
	 string formula,	# dice roll formula
	 int min_expected,	# lowest legal return value
	 int max_expected,	# highest legal return value
	 int num_rolls)		# number of rolls to test
</pre>
that will do this, and use it to test each of the basic types of roll formula:
<TABLE border="1">
    <tr><th align=center>formula</th>
    	<th align=center>min expected</th>
	<th align=center>max expected</th>
	<th align=center>num rolls</th> </tr>
    <tr> <td>"3D4"</td>		<td>3</td>	<td>12</td>	<td>40</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>"d20"</td>		<td>1</td>	<td>20</td>	<td>80</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>"D%"</td>		<td>1</td>	<td>100</td>	<td>300</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>"2D2+3"</td>	<td>5</td>	<td>7</td>	<td>7</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>"3-9"</td>		<td>3</td>	<td>9</td>	<td>9</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>"47"</td>		<td>47</td>	<td>47</td>	<td>10</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>47</td>		<td>47</td>	<td>47</td>	<td>10</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>"-3"</td>		<td>-3</td>	<td>-3</td>	<td>10</td> </tr>
</TABLE>
</P>

<P>
The obvious formula errors are typos and missing values:
<ul>
    <li> missing number of faces (e.g. "2D")</li>
    <li> non-numeric limits, number of dice, or number of faces (e.g. "D", "xDy", "x-y")</li>
    <li> ranges where the last number is missing or lower than the first (e.g. "-", "4-2", "3-")</li>
    <li> ranges using a separator other than "-" (e.g. "7 to 9")</li>
</ul>


<A name="gameactor"/><H3>GameActor Unit Testing</H3>
<P>
By far, the most interesting code in <em>GameActor</em> is the ATTACK handling
in the <tt>accept_action()</tt> method.  The obvious things to check are:
<ul>
   <li> confirming correct comparison of incoming TO_HIT vs general, base-verb,
        and sub-type EVASION</li>
   <li> confirming correct use of D100 rolls to determine whether or 
        not an ATTACK succeeds</li>
   <li> confirming correct comparison of incoming TOTAL damage vs general,
   	base-verb, and sub-type PROTECTION</li>
   <li> confirming correct updates to the <tt>LIFE</tt>, <tt>alive</tt>,
        and <tt>disabled</tt> in response to received damage</li>
</ul>
The simplest tests of attribute comparison and LIFE update are:
<ul>
   <li> initiating an attack that (due to poor ACCURACY) is sure
        to fail, and confirming that it fails and has no effect
        on the recipient's LIFE</li>

   <li> initiating an attack that (due to excellent EVASION) is sure
        to fail, and confirming that it fails and has no effect
        on the recipient's LIFE</li>

   <li> initiating an attack that would only fail if both the
        base and sub-type EVASION were included, and confirming
        that it does indeed fail with no effect on LIFE.</li>

   <li> initiating an attack that (due to excellent ACCURACY and
        excellent PROTECTION) is is sure to land, but will deliver
        no damage, and confirming that it succeeds but has no effect
        on the recipient's LIFE</li>

   <li> initiating an attack that (due to perfect ACCURACY, and
        no PROTECTION) is sure to succeed, and confirming that
        it succeeds and correctly reduces the recipient's LIFE</li>

   <li> initiating an attack that is sure to succeed, but
        have its damage reduced by the combination of base
        and sub-typte PROTECTION, and confirming that the
        correct reduction in lost LIFE points.</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
Non-ATTACK (condition affecting) actions are not implemented in this
class, but forwarded to our underlying <em>GameObject</em> super-class.
Even though those actions are not actually processed in this class, 
we should still confirm that they are correctly forwarded and have
the expected effects on <u>our</u> attributes, based on 
<u>our</u> RESISTANCEs:
<ul>
   <li> initiating an action that (due to poor POWER) is sure
        to fail, and confirming that it has no effect on the 
        associated attribute</li>

   <li> initiating an action that (due to excellent RESISTANCE)
        is sure to to fail, and confirming no change to the
        names attribute</li>

   <li> initiating an action that would only fail if both the
        base and sub-type RESISTANCE were included, and confirming
        that it does indeed fail with no effect on the associated
        attribute</li>

   <li> initiating an action that (because we have no RESISTANCE)
        is sure to deliver all of its STACKS, and confriming that
        the associated attribute has gone up by the number of 
        STACKS</li>

</ul>
We can test the use of dice rolls:
<ul>
   <li>	initiating an ATTACK that (as a result of 0 ACCURACY and
   	50% EVASION) should get through (roughly) half the time,
	performing it ten times, and confirming (by both success
	returns and LIFE attribute updates) that it got through
	some of the time and failed some of the time</li>

   <li>	initiating an MENTAL action that (as a result of 0 POWER and
   	50% RESISTANCE) should get through (roughly) half the time,
	performing it ten times, and confirming (by both success
	returns and updates to the associated attribute) that it
	got through some of the time and failed some of the time</li>
</ul>
</P>

<A name="gamecontext"/><H3>GameContext Unit Testing</H3>
<P>
The <em>GameContext</em> implementation is, for the most part, a trivial extension
of the base <em>GameObject</em> class, and is easily exercised with a few
<em>black-box</em> tests:
<ul>
   <li> testing the <tt>add_member()</tt>, <tt>remove_member()</tt>
   	and <tt>get_party()</tt> methods can be done by starting
	with an empty <em>GameContext</em>, and doing a series of
	<tt>add_member()</tt> and <tt>remove_member()</tt> calls
	(in different combinations), confirming after each that
	<tt>get_party()</tt> returns the expected list.</li>

   <li> testing the NPC methods is the same: start with an empty
   	<em>GameContext</em>, and do a series of <tt>add_npc()</tt>
	and <tt>remove_npc()</tt> calls (in different combinations),
	confirming after each that <tt>get_npcs()</tt> returns
	the expected list.</li>

   <li> the hierarchical <tt>get()</tt> functionality can be tested by
   	creating a context, a parent, and a grand-parent which define
	overlapping and distinct attributes, and confirming that
	<tt>get()</tt> operations on the lowest child correctly return
	the most proximate value for the requested attribute.</li>

   <li> the SEARCH action can be created by creating some test objects
   	(that will resist a certain number of SEARCH operations), doing
	a series of SEARCHes, and confirming that each successive
	SEARCH discovers the expected objects.</li>
</ul>
</P>

<A name="integrated"/><H3>Whole Component Test Cases</H3>
<P>
Some of the obvious unit test cases involve the interactions of multiple
classes, and so I have chosen to put these into the (<em>PyTest</em>)
<tt>test_cardfrp.py</tt> module.  These include:
<ul>
   <li>	loading a simple <em>GameActor</em> description from a file
   	and confirming the correct setting of name, description,
	and a few attributes</li>

   <li> loading a complex <em>GameActor</em> description (that includes
   	enabled actions and posessed objects) from a file, and confirm
	that they were all correctly instantiated</li>

   <li>	loading a <em>GameContext</em> description that includes both
        visible and hidden objects from a file, and confirm their presence,
	and that (sufficient) SEARCH operations will discover the hidden
	objects</li>

   <li> having one <em>GameActor</em> obtain a list of possible
   	<em>interaction</em>s from another, and exercise them,
	confirming that those with sufficient POWER or STACKS
	succeed and have the intended effects</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
In addition to these "does it work" test cases, there is a
<tt>scenarios.py</tt> that provides demonstrations of fully
integrated functionality:
<ul>
   <li> all possible actions performed in the local context</li>
   <li>	all possible non-COMBAT actions performed with an NPC</li>
   <li> combat (to the death) with a group of NPCs</li>
   <li> compound attack weapon use (e.g. a poisoned dagger)</li>
   <li> the use and efficacy of magical artifacts (e.g. scrolls
    	and potions): cure Light Wounds, and Courage</li>
</ul>
