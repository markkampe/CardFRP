<H1>CardFRP - Component Overview<br>
<strong>(and required functionality for each class)</strong>
</H1>
</center>
<P>
CardFRP is an underlying (not player-facing) engine that simulates the
attributes and interactions of characters and objects in locations.
It is intended to implement mechanics similar to those of FRPGs where
players take actions by playing (physical) cards from a hand of available
actions.
</P>
<P>
This engine implements:
<ul>
	<li><strong>objects</strong> (e.g. weapons and artifacts) with capabilities and attributes</li>
	<li><strong>actors</strong> (PCs and NPCs) with abilities, attributes, and objects</li>
	<li><strong>actions</strong> (e.g. search, bribe, attack), 
	    possibly enabled by objects (e.g. a sword or a scroll),
	    which (when performed by actors)
	    affect the attributes of other actors and objects</li>
	<li><strong>contexts</strong> (e.g. rooms, villages, kingdoms)
	    potentially nested,
	    with attributes,
	    containing objects and actors,
	    where interactions take place</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
This functionality is implemented by a few (Python) classes:
<ul>
    <li><A href="html/gameobject.GameObject-class.html">GameObject</A>,
    	which implements most objects, and serve as the base class for:
	<ul>
	    <li>
	    <A href="html/gameactor.GameActor-class.html">GameActor</A>,
	    	which implements PCs and NPCs.
	    </li>
	    <li><A href="html/gamecontext.GameContext-class.html">GameContext</A>,
	    	which implements locations, containing objects and actors.
	    </li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> <A href="html/gameaction.GameAction-class.html">GameAction</A>,
    	which implements interactions between objects and characters in locations.
    </li>
    <li><A Href="html/dice.Dice-class.html">Dice</a>,
    	which implement rolls according to common formula
	(e.g. "3D6+2", "3-20", "D%", or even "47")
    </li>
</ul>
</P>

<H3>GameObject</H3>
<P>
A <A href="html/gameobject.GameObject-class.html">GameObject</A> ...
<ul>
    <li>has a list of (string) verbs that describe the actions of which it is capable</li>
    <li>is capable of receiving, and computing consequences of an action</li>
    <li>can posssess or contain other GameObjects</li>
</ul>
It implements methods to:
<ul>
    <li>return a list of supported <em>GameAction</em>s</li>
    <li>update, search, and return the list of contained <em>GameObject</em>s</li>
    <li>accept a (non-<tt>ATTACK</tt>) <em>GameAction</em> and compute and return 
        its consequences</li>
</ul>
</P>


<H3>GameAction</H3>
<P>
A <A <A href="html/gameaction.GameAction-class.html">GameAction</A> represents
an interaction between players and/or objects.
A played <em>GameAction</em> has:
<ul>
   <li> a verb (which might be sub-typed or compound) </li>
   <li>	an object (or actor) that enables it to be performed </li>
   <li> an actor who initiates it </li>
   <li> an actor or object that is to receive it </li>
   <li> a context (or location) in which the interaction takes place </li>
</ul>
</p>
<P>
It is intended that the interaction functionality in the base <em>GameAction</em>
and <em>GameActor</em> classes be sufficient to implement most typical gamic
interactions.  These classes support two basic types of action:
<ul>
   <li> combat (verbs beginning with <tt>ATTACK.</tt>)
	<ul>
   	   <li>	Objects (e.g. swords) and initiators (e.g. PCs and NPCs)
	    	have <tt>ACCURACY</tt> and <tt>DAMAGE</tt> attributes.</li>
	   <li>	Recipients (e.g. objects, PCs and NPCs) have
	    	<tt>EVASION</tt> and <tt>PROTECTION</tt> attributes.</li>
	   <li> If <tt>D100</tt> plus the recipient's <tt>EVASION</tt> is
	   	greater than <tt>D100</tt> plus the (combined) <tt>ACCURACY</tt>
        attributes, the attack fails.</li>
	   <li> If the (combined) <tt>DAMAGE</tt> attribute(s) exceeds
	   	the recipient's <tt>PROTECTION</tt>,
		the remaining <tt>DAMAGE</tt> is subtracted from the
		recipient's <tt>LIFE</tt> attribute.</li>
	   <li>	If the recipient's <tt>LIFE</tt> goes to (or below)
	   	zero, his <tt>alive</tt> attribute is set to <tt>False</tt>,
		and his <tt>incapacitated</tt> attribute is set to <tt>True</tt>.</li>
	</ul>
   </li>
   <li> all other interactions<br>
	<ul>
	   <li> Recipients (e.g. objects, PCs, or NPCs) can have 
	   	arbitrary attributes, that can be affected by 
		interactions and affect behavior (e.g.  <tt>MENTAL.FEAR</tt>
		or <tt>VERBAL.FLATTERY</tt>).
	   	Attribute affecting verbs have the same name as the
		attribute they affect.</li>
   	   <li>	Objects (e.g. scrolls) and initiators (e.g. PCs and NPCs)
	    	have <tt>POWER</tt> and <tt>STACKS</tt> attributes
		that reflect their ability to initiate such interactions.</li>
	   <li>	Recipients (e.g. objects, PCs and NPCs) have
	    	<tt>RESISTANCE</tt> attributes.</li>
	   <li> If <tt>D100</tt> plus the recipient's <tt>RESISTANCE</tt> is
	   	greater than <tt>D100</tt> plus the (combined) <tt>POWER</tt> 
        attributes, the action fails.</li>
	   <li> This test is performed for each of the delivered
	   	<tt>STACKS</tt>.  For each <tt>STACK</tt> that gets
		through, the recipient's corresponding attribute
		is increased by one.
		</li>
	</ul>
   </li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
Characters will have different skill levels for different actions.
<tt>ACCURACY</tt>, <tt>POWER</tt>, <tt>DAMAGE</tt>, <tt>STACKS</tt>,
<tt>EVASION</tt>, <tt>RESISTANCE</tt> and <tt>PROTECTION</tt>
attributes can be sub-typed to reflect these differences:
<TABLE align="center" border="1">
<tr><th>Attribute</th> <th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>DAMAGE</td>		<td>amount added to all attacks</td></tr>
<tr><td>DAMAGE.GRAPPLE</td>	<td>amount added to grappling attacks</td></tr>
<tr><td>ACCURACY.ARROW</td>	<td>accuracy bonus when using bow</td></tr>
<tr><td>EVASION</td>		<td>ability to evade all attacks</td></tr>
<tr><td>EVASION.STAB</td>	<td>ability to evade stabbing attacks</td></tr>
<tr><td>PROTECTION.POISON</td>	<td>ability to resist effects of poison</td></tr>
<tr><td>POWER.SEARCH</td>	<td>ability to find hidden things</td></tr>
<tr><td>POWER.MENTAL.FEAR</td>	<td>ability to cause fear</td></tr>
<tr><td>RESISTANCE.SEARCH</td>	<td>how well hidden something is</td></tr>
<tr><td>RESISTANCE.MENTAL</td>	<td>resistance to all mental attacks</td></tr>
<tr><td>RESISTANCE.VERBAL.BRIBE</tt>	<td>specific resistance to bribery attempts</td></tr>
</TABLE>
</P>
<P>
In addition to action verbs having sub-types, they can also be compounded ...
so that a single action delivers multiple verbs.  A poisoned dagger might,
for instance, enable the action <tt>ATTACK.STAB+ATTACK.POISON</tt>.
When this action is initiated:
<ul>
   <li> an <tt>ATTACK.STAB</tt> will be delivered to the recipient.</li>
   <li> if that is successful (not evaded and not absorbed by armour),
    	an <tt>ATTACK.POISON</tt> will be delivered to the recpient.</li>
   <li> the delivery of successive actions ceases with the first failure
   	(evasion or absorbtion).</li>
</ul>
</P>

<H3>GameActor</H3>
<P>
<A href="html/gameactor.GameActor-class.html">GameActor</A> is a sub-class of
<em>GameObject</em>.  In addition to those inherited capabilities and attributes,
a <em>GameActior</em>
<ul>
   <li> has a current context (in which it is located)</li>
   <li> has a list of supported <tt>VERBAL</tt> interaction verbs,
   	    that can be turned into <em>GameAction</em>s
        and used by a requesting <em>GameActor</em></li>
   <li> is capable of initiating any available <em>GameAction</em> with
   	designated recpient.</li>
   <li> is capable of accepting <tt>ATTACK</tt> <em>GameAction</em>s,
        to process <tt>EVASION</tt>, <tt>PROTECTION</tt> and <tt>DAMAGE</tt>.
        Non-ATTACK (attribute affecting) <em>GameAction</em>s are processed
        by its (<em>GameObject</em>) super-class. </li>
</ul>

<H3>GameContext</H3>
<P>
A <A href="html/gamecontext.GameContext-class.html">GameContext</A> is another
sub-class of <em>GameObject</em>.  The interesting characteristics it adds are:
<ul>
   <li> it can keep track of PCs and NPCs who are currently in that
   	<em>GameContext</em> and return lists of them to any requestor.</li>
   <li>	it supports a list of contained objects (including hidden objects)
   	and accepts <tt>SEARCH</tt> <em>GameAction</em>s to discover them.</li>
   <li> like a <em>GameActor</em> it has a list of supported interactions
   	(e.g. <tt>SEARCH</tt>) that it can return as a set of possible
	<em>GameAction</em>s (to any requesting <em>GameActor</em>)</li>
   <li> it can have a <em>parent</em> context.  A room might be within an Inn,
   	which might be within a village, which might be within a forrest, 
	which might be within a kingdom.
	<ul>
	   <li> any attribute <tt>get()</tt> that it cannot satisfy
	    	will be passed up the chain of <em>parent</em>s</li>
	   <li> the list of <tt>possible_actions()</tt> that it returns
	   	is the union of its, and those of all of its <em>parent</em>s.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
