<H2>CardFRP - Component Overview</H2>
</center>
<P>
CardFRP is an underlying (not player-facing) engine that simulates the
attributes and interactions of characters and objects in locations.
It is intended to implement mechanics similar to those of FRPGs where
players act by playing physical cards from a hand of available actions.
</P>
<P>
This engine implements:
<ul>
	<li><strong>objects</strong> (e.g. weapons and artifacts) with capabilities and attributes</li>
	<li><strong>actors</strong> (PCs and NPCs) with abilities, attributes, and objects</li>
	<li><strong>actions</strong> (e.g. search, bribe, attack), 
	    possibly enabled by objects (e.g. a sword or a scroll),
	    which (when performed by actors)
	    affect the attributes of other actors and objects</li>
	<li><strong>contexts</strong> (e.g. rooms, villages, kingdoms)
	    potentially nested,
	    with attributes,
	    containing objects and actors,
	    where interactions take place</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
These are implemented by a few (Python) classes:
<ul>
    <li><A href="html/gameobject.GameObject-class.html">GameObject</A>,
    	which implements most objects, and serve as the base class for:
	<ul>
	    <li>
	    <A href="html/gameactor.GameActor-class.html">GameActor</A>
	    </li>
	    <li><A href="html/gamecontext.GameContext-class.html">GameContext</A>
	    </li>
	</ul>
    </li>
    <li> <A href="html/gameaction.GameAction-class.html">GameAction</A>,
    	which implements interactions between objects and characters in locations.
    </li>
    <li><A Href="html/dice.Dice-class.html">Dice</a>,
    	which implement rolls according to common formula
	(e.g. "3D6+2", "3-20", "D%", or even "47")
    </li>
</ul>
</P>

<H3>Summary of (required) functionality for each class</H3>
<H4>GameObject</H4>
<P>
A <A href="html/gameobject.GameObject-class.html">GameObject</A> ...
<ul>
    <li>has a list of (string) verbs that describe the actions of which it is capable</li>
    <li>is capable of receiving, and computing consequences of an action</li>
    <li>can posssess or contain other GameObjects</li>
</ul>
It implements methods to:
<ul>
    <li>return a list of supported <em>GameAction</em>s</li>
    <li>update, search, and return the list of contained <em>GameObject</em>s</li>
    <li>accept a <em>GameAction</em> and compute and return its consequences</li>
</ul>
</P>


<H4>GameAction</H4>
<P>
A <A <A href="html/gameaction.GameAction-class.html">GameAction</A> is based 
on a verb (which might be compound or have sub-types).  Examples might be:
<ul>
    <li>SEARCH</LI>
    <li>MENTAL.INTIMMIDATE</li>
    <li>ATTACK.STAB+ATTACK.POISON</li>
</ul>
A <em>GameObject</em> has attributes that describe the skill and impact with
which its actions will be executed:
<ul>
   <li> skill is described as a percentage ... 
   	<tt>ACCURACY</tt> for <tt>ATTACK</tt> verbs and 
	<tt>POWER</tt> for others.</li>
   <li> impact is described as a dice formula ...
   	<tt>DAMAGE</tt> for <tt>ATTACK</tt> verbs and
   	<tt>STACKS</tt> for others.</li>
</ul>
The initiator <em>GameActor</em> who performs the action may have additional
bonuses (in attributes like <tt>DAMAGE</tt> or
<tt>POWER.MENTAL.INTIMMIDATE</tt>) ... which will be added to the base
values in the <em>GameAction</em>.
</P>
<P>
When the <em>GameAction</em><tt>.act()</tt> method is called
(from an initiator, against a target, in a location)
<ol type="1">
   <li>The <em>GameAction</em> adds together all of the base and 
       initiator bonses, and
       Stores these in <tt>TO_HIT</tt> and <tt>TOTAL</tt> attributes</li>
   <li>Calls the target's <tt>accept_action()</tt> method</li>
   <li>Target adds together all of its applicable <tt>RESISTANCE</tt> attributes</li>
   <li>If the sum of the target's <tt>RESISTANCE</tt>s is greater than or equal to the
       incoming <tt>TO_HIT</tt>, the action fails.</li>
   <li>For each incoming unit (of <tt>TOTAL</tt>) the target rolls D100 
       against the amount by which <tt>TOTAL</tt> exceeded <tt>RESISTANCE</tt>.<br>
       If the D100 roll is less than that net-power, one unit of action gets through.</li>
   <li>For the simple actions (supported by this base class), any action that gets
       through results in an increment (or decrement for <tt>ATTACK</tt>s) of the
       attribute whose name matches the successful verb.
       (e.g. if two stacks of <tt>MENTAL.IMTIMMIDATE</tt> get past the recipient's 
       <tt>RESISTANCE.MENTAL</tt>, the recipient's <tt>INTIMMIDATE</tt> attribute
       will be incremented by two).
       </li>
